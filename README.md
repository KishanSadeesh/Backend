Of course. Here is a complete README.md file for your project. You can copy and paste this directly into a README.md file in your project's root directory.

Smart Task Planner
A simple yet powerful backend API that uses AI to break down high-level user goals into a detailed, actionable plan with tasks, dependencies, and timelines.

Description
The Smart Task Planner takes a natural language goal (e.g., "Launch a new personal blog in 1 month") and leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) through OpenRouter to generate a structured JSON response. This response outlines a complete project plan, which can be used by any frontend application to display a project timeline, a to-do list, or a task board.

Features
AI-Powered Planning: Uses powerful models like DeepSeek to reason and generate logical task breakdowns.

Dependency Mapping: Automatically identifies which tasks must be completed before others can begin.

Timeline Estimation: Provides an estimated duration in days for each task.

Structured JSON Output: Returns a clean, predictable JSON object, making it easy to integrate with any frontend.

Interactive API Docs: Built with FastAPI, it provides automatic, interactive documentation via Swagger UI.

Technology Stack
Backend: Python

API Framework: FastAPI

LLM Provider: OpenRouter

LLM: DeepSeek (deepseek/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct)

Server: Uvicorn

üöÄ Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the project running locally.

1. Clone the Repository
Bash

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd smart-planner
2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

macOS / Linux:

Bash

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Windows:

Bash

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python packages from requirements.txt.

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set Up Environment Variables
You'll need an API key from OpenRouter to use the service.

Create a new file named .env in the root of the project directory.

Go to OpenRouter.ai to get your free API key.

Add your key to the .env file like this:

OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
‚ö°Ô∏è Usage
Once the setup is complete, you can run the API server.

1. Run the Server
Execute the following command in your terminal from the project's root directory:

Bash

uvicorn main:app --reload
The --reload flag automatically restarts the server whenever you make changes to the code. The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

2. Test the Endpoint
You can test the API in two easy ways:

A) Using the Interactive Docs (Recommended)

Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

Expand the POST /generate-plan endpoint.

Click "Try it out" and provide a JSON object with your goal and duration.

Click "Execute" to see the AI-generated plan.

B) Using cURL

Open another terminal and run the following cURL command:

Bash

curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/generate-plan' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "goal": "Build a weather app in 2 weeks",
  "duration": "2 weeks"
}'
API Endpoint Reference

    }
  ]
}
